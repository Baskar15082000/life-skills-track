# Learning Process

## What is the Feynman Technique?

The Feynman Technique is explaining a concept in simple terms, identifying gaps, and revisiting until a thorough understanding is reached.

## what was the most interesting story or idea for you?

Barbara Oakley's inspiring story of overcoming challenges in learning, from struggling with math to earning a PhD in engineering, underscores the importance of effective learning strategies. Her advice includes the value of relaxation for creativity, overcoming procrastination with the Pomodoro Technique, and the significance of practice and repetition in mastering subjects, making her tips practical and accessible for anyone looking to enhance their learning journey.

## What are active and diffused modes of thinking?

**Active Mode of Thinking:**

Active thinking involves focused and concentrated mental effort. When you are actively thinking, you are consciously engaged in a task, problem-solving, or learning. This mode is associated with targeted, goal-oriented cognitive activities.

**Diffused Mode of Thinking:**

Diffused thinking, on the other hand, is a more relaxed state of mental processing. It occurs when your mind is not actively concentrated on a specific task. During diffused thinking, your brain is free to make connections, process information in the background, and engage in more holistic, creative thinking. This mode is often linked to moments of insight and a broader perspective on ideas.

## According to the video, what are the steps to take when approaching a new topic? Only mention the points.

**Prewriting:** Begin by selecting your writing topic, conducting necessary research, and narrowing down the focus. Explore relevant sources and take thorough notes to prepare for the writing process.

**Identify a Problem:** Clearly define a research problem associated with your chosen topic. This problem can be practical or theoretical. Establish objectives and craft a concise problem statement that outlines the issue.

**Formulate Research Questions:** Based on your problem statement, create specific and targeted research questions. These questions serve as the foundation for your investigative work, guiding the direction of your research.

**Create a Research Design:** Develop a comprehensive plan outlining the structure and approach for your research. Consider the logical flow and organization of information to ensure a coherent presentation of your findings.

**Write a Research Proposal:** Summarize your research plan in a well-structured proposal, encompassing the identified problem, research questions, and design. A carefully crafted proposal lays the groundwork for the success of your research project.

## Key Actions to Improve Learning Process:

**Feynman Technique:** Regularly explain concepts to reinforce understanding.

**Personal Connections:** Relate new information to personal experiences for better retention.

**Focused Time:** Allocate dedicated, uninterrupted time for learning.

**Minimize Distractions:** Turn off notifications and create a focused environment.

**Productivity Apps:** Use tools like Boosted for time tracking and productivity.

**Reflection:** Periodically reflect on learning progress and adjust strategies.

**Feedback:** Actively seek feedback on explanations and implementations.

**Deep Work Principles:** Embrace principles from "Deep Work" for concentration.

**Goals and Deadlines:** Set clear learning goals and deadlines.

**Enjoyable Learning:** Make the learning process enjoyable to foster intrinsic motivation.
